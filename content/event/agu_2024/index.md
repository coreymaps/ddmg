summary: "Tracking the Footprint of War: Earth and Environmental Science Perspectives on Monitoring Conflict Impacts"
abstract: 'Armed conflicts are a defining global challenge with immediate and long-lasting consequences. From collapsing dams to destroyed cities, from agricultural abandonment to wholesale ecosystem loss, the impacts of war on the environment are severe and widespread. Diverse efforts to monitor the timing, geographic breadth, and severity of the environmental costs of war provide an unprecedented level of awareness and documentation but many conflicts, regions, and impacted communities remain un- or under-documented. We welcome contributions that seek to characterize environmental impacts of war in novel and tangible ways. Contributions may use remote Earth observation or field-based methods, assess direct or indirect impacts, or come from across disciplines. We intend for the session to contribute to building collaborations and capacities across science, policy, and practice domains, advance the science of conflict impact assessment, and ultimately help address the challenges at hand.'
